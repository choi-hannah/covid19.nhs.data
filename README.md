# Trust-level COVID-19 hospitalisations in England

This repo contains two items of data:

1. Trust-level hospital admissions data, published weekly on the [NHS COVID-19 Hospital Activity](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-hospital-activity/) webpage. The most-recently downloaded data can be found in [data/raw/nhs_statistics](https://github.com/sophiemeakin/covid19-uk-hospitalisation-data/tree/main/data/raw/nhs_statistics).
2. A many-to-many mapping between lower-tier local authority districts (LTLAs) and NHS Acute Trusts in England; details of this mapping (including a summary of the methods and a quick-start guide) can be found in [reports/trust-ltla_mapping_summary](https://github.com/sophiemeakin/covid19-uk-hospitalisation-data/tree/main/reports/trust-ltla_mapping_summary).
